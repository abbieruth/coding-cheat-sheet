# Coding Cheat Sheet

This is just a simple coding cheat sheet I built for myself.  I might tweak the design later.  I would like to add to the CSS table and maybe even add a 
JavaScript table later on.

# How It's Made:
**Tech Used:
HTML, CSS

That's really all there is to it.  It's just a simple, one-page site: no JavaScript or frameworks needed.

#Lessons Learned:
I learned a lot more than just building tables during this project. I hope to add to the page as I continue learning about Web Development.
